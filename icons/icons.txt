ToastMCP icons: how to name and size them

Supported format
- PNG only.

Naming
- Use short, expressive names (e.g., proud, oops, plan).
- Stick to lowercase letters, numbers, and dashes or underscores.
- The filename (without .png) becomes the icon id.

Resolution suggestions
- Square images work best.
- 48x48 is the Windows toast default size; 64x64 is a good source size.
- Keep a little padding so details don't get cropped in the toast.

Tips
- Transparency is supported (alpha channel).
- Use icons/backup for working copies while resizing/editing or when temporarily removing an icon for testing. We don't ship backup/ dirs, and ToastMCP ignores them.
