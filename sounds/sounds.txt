ToastMCP sounds: how to name and format them

Supported format
- WAV only (PCM recommended).

Naming
- Use short, expressive names (e.g., success, error, alert).
- Stick to lowercase letters, numbers, and dashes or underscores.
- The filename (without .wav) becomes the sound id.

Format suggestions
- Mono or stereo are both fine.
- 16-bit PCM WAV is the safest choice.
- Keep clips short and distinct (0.2s?2s is ideal).

Tips
- Use sounds/backup for working copies while editing or when temporarily removing a sound for testing. We don't ship backup/ dirs, and ToastMCP ignores them.
- Note: .wav files are git-ignored in this repo.
